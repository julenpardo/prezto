interface environment with sane defaults, aliases, functions, auto completion,

## Installation

Prezto will work with any recent release of Zsh, but the minimum required
version is 4.3.17.

* Create all the configs.
* Set it as default shell.

### Troubleshooting

If you are not able to find certain commands after switching to _Prezto_,
modify the `PATH` variable in _~/.zprofile_ then open a new Zsh terminal
window or tab.
